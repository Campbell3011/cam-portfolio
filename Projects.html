        <h3 class="proj-title">Project 1 - Death</h3>
        <p class="proj-desc">
            This is one of the peices that i worked on when it came to the exam period in my A Level Photography Course. The theme was 'Endings'
            and i looked into the biblical reference of 'The Four Horsemen Of the Apocalypse', this is the passage that states there are four ways
            the world will end and one of these ways and the horsemen is named Death. To portray this I am using nature's death as the main focal
            point, so I have been using the death of roses as a way to show the stages to plant death.
            <br>
            I originally looked at all the horsemen until I futher looked at 'Death' and saw an opportunity to hone in my skills on this section of
            my wider idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            I looked into the works of a photographer named Keith Dotson, one of his focal points was dead flowers, in black and white so this was part
            of my inspiration to look more into dead and withering flowers, this also linked in with one of the horsemen on the bigger picture. This may
            only be one of them but it will show the idea when explained to the examiner through my own photographs. Upon further research I looked into 
            Andrés Rozo Samer who also photographed dead flowers and leaves, making them curl and displaying them in unique and artistic ways. I then 
            replicated the work focussing closely on aspects of their work like the subject and how certain areas are focussed on within their own work.

                Keith Dotson is a contemporary photographer living in Nashville, Tennessee, who creates art for a global audience. He specialises in black 
                and white photography and his favourite subjects include landscapes, cityscapes and abstractions from nature. 
                <br>
                <br>
                With photography, Keith Dotson presents straight-forward black and white images, allowing the drama and mood of the subject to shine. He prefers 
                the look and atmosphere of soft light, often shooting on overcast or stormy days that keep other photographers at home. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                Keith's photographs appeared in two major motion pictures including the 2016 movie Why Him? and the 2018 action film Peppermint, starring Jennifer 
                Garner. His photographs had multi-season recurring roles on the sets of Grey's Anatomy and Melissa and Joey, and have appeared in other TV shows 
                like Modern Family, Gossip Girl, The Mindy Project, and Tyler Perry's Sistas.
