            Heros Trail is a part of the projects that was made as part of my IT course within the Doncaster UTC.
            This was made to show and make purpose of the skills learnt within the unit and for this the assignment was to research
            and make a prototype to a game that was unique and our own idea. This came with doccumenting the research and then the plan

            This was interesting to see what developing a prototype did include the doccuments like the planning of the prototype and the 
            the plans of the idea. This was vital to ensure the accurate type of work that was
